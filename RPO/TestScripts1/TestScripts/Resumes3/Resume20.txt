Project Description:
Landmark Analytics is designed to provide Business Intelligent reporting by assimilating data from various source systems and then constructing business area specific warehouse which holds the operational data in a consolidated fashion. Landmark Analytics can immediately publish this information across the organization to application users, bypassing the normal reporting bottlenecks inherent in application reporting processes. Landmark Analytics offers tools to expose tactical and strategic information held within millions of transactions (of source application databases). Imagine helps consolidating data from more than one application database; hence Landmark Analytics reports and dashboards generate the information needed for effective business planning. Landmark Analytics also provides toolset to enable a set of trained user to design custom reports.
Landmark Analytics is integrated over the operational data for Landmark, OSi, Novar, and Vision to build the Broadcast data warehouse.
